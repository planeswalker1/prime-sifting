// Prime Sifting
// Given a number, write a method that returns all of the prime numbers less than that number.

// Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to solve it.Here's how the Sieve of Eratosthenes works to find a number up to a given number:

// Create a list of numbers from 2 through n: 2, 3, 4, ..., number.
// Initially, let prime equal 2, the first prime number.
// Starting from prime, remove all multiples of prime from the list.
// Increment prime by 1.
// When you reach number, all the remaining numbers in the list are primes.
